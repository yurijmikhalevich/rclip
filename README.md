**rclip** is a command-line photo search tool powered by the awesome OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) neural network.

## Installation

### Linux

```bash
sudo snap install rclip
```

<details>
  <summary>Alternative options (AppImage and <code>pip</code>)</summary>

  If your Linux distribution doesn't support [snap](https://snapcraft.io/rclip), you can use one of the alternative installation options:

  #### AppImage (self-contained x86_64 executable)

  On Linux x86_64, you can install **rclip** as a self-contained executable.

  1. Download the AppImage from the latest [release](https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip/releases).

  2. Execute the following commands:

  ```bash
  chmod +x <downloaded AppImage filename>
  sudo mv <downloaded AppImage filename> /usr/local/bin/rclip
  ```

  #### Using <code>pip</code>

  ```bash
  pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu rclip
  ```
</details>

### macOS

```bash
brew install yurijmikhalevich/tap/rclip
```

<details>
  <summary>Alternative option (<code>pip</code>)</summary>

  ```bash
  pip install rclip
  ```
</details>

### Windows

1. Download the "*.msi" from the latest [release](https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip/releases).
2. Install **rclip** by running the installer.

Note: if you previously installed **rclip** using the "-installer.exe" installer, you must manually uninstall the previous version.

<details>
  <summary>Alternative option (<code>pip</code>)</summary>

  ```bash
  pip install rclip
  ```
</details>

## Usage

```bash
cd photos && rclip "search query"
```

<img alt="rclip usage demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip/main/resources/rclip-usage.gif" width="640px" />

When you run **rclip** for the first time in a particular directory, it will extract features from the photos, which takes time. How long it will take depends on your CPU and the number of pictures you will search through. It took about a day to process 73 thousand photos on my NAS, which runs an old-ish IntelÂ CeleronÂ J3455, 7 minutes to index 50 thousand images on my MacBook with an M1 Max CPU, and three hours to process 1.28 million images on the same MacBook.

For a detailed demonstration, watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJHXOkHidw.

### Similar image search

You can use another image as a query by passing a file path or even an URL to the image file, and **rclip** will find the images most similar to the one you used as a query. If you are referencing a local image via a relative path, you **must** prefix it with `./`. For example:

```bash
cd photos && rclip ./cat.jpg

# or use URL
cd photos && rclip https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip/main/tests/e2e/images/cat.jpg
```

Check this video out for the image-to-image search demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQZKeCBxWM.

### Combining multiple queries

You can add and subtract image and text queries from each other; here are a few usage examples:

```bash
cd photos && rclip horse + stripes
cd photos && rclip apple - fruit
cd photos && rclip "./new york city.jpg" + night
cd photos && rclip "2:golden retriever" + "./swimming pool.jpg"
cd photos && rclip "./racing car.jpg" - "2:sports car" + "2:snow"
```

If you want to see how these queries perform when executed on the 1.28 million images ImageNet-1k dataset, check out the demo on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsTgYdOpgcQ.

### How do I preview the results?

If you are using either one of [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) (version 22.04 and higher), [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), [Mintty](https://mintty.github.io/), or [mlterm](https://mlterm.sourceforge.net/) all you need to do is pass `--preview` (or `-p`) argument to **rclip**:

```bash
rclip -p kitty
```

<details>
  <summary>Using a different terminal or viewer</summary>

  If you are using any other terminal or want to view the results in your viewer of choice, you can pass the output of **rclip** to it. For example, on Linux, the command from below will open top-5 results for "kitty" in your default image viewer:

  ```bash
  rclip -f -t 5 kitty | xargs -d '\n' -n 1 xdg-open
  ```

  The `-f` param or `--filepath-only` makes **rclip** print the file paths only, without scores or the header, which makes it ideal to use together with a custom viewer as in the example.
  
  I prefer to use **feh**'s thumbnail mode to preview multiple results:

  ```bash
  rclip -f -t 5 kitty | feh -f - -t
  ```
