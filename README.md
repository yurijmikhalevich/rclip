**rclip** is a command-line photo search tool based on the awesome OpenAI's [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) neural network.

## Installation

Currently, pre-built distributable is available only for Linux x86_64.

1. Download the AppImage from the latest [release](https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip/releases).

2. Execute the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x <downloaded AppImage filename>
sudo mv <downloaded AppImage filename> /usr/local/bin/rclip
```

## Usage

```bash
cd photos && rclip "search query"
```

When you run **rclip** for the first time in a particular directory, it's going to extract features from the photos, and this takes time. How long it takes depends on your CPU and the number of pictures you will search through. It took about a day to process 73 thousand photos on my NAS, which runs an old-ish IntelÂ CeleronÂ J3455.

For a detailed demonstration, watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJHXOkHidw.

You can also use another image as a query by passing a file path or even an URL to the image file, and **rclip** will find the images most similar to the one you used as a query. If you are referencing a local image via a relative path, you **must** prefix it with `./`. For example:

```bash
cd photos && rclip ./cat.jpg

# or use URL
cd photos && rclip https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip/main/tests/e2e/images/cat.jpg
```

### How do I preview the results?

The command from below will open top-5 results for "kitty" in your default image viewer:

```bash
rclip -f -t 5 kitty | xargs -d '\n' -n 1 xdg-open
```

I prefer to use `feh`'s thumbnail mode to preview multiple results:

```bash
rclip -f -t 5 kitty | feh -f - -t
```

## Help

```bash
rclip --help
```

### Running locally from the source code

To run **rclip** locally from the source code, you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

Then do:
```bash
# clone the source code repository
git clone git@github.com:yurijmikhalevich/rclip.git

# install dependencies and rclip
cd rclip
poetry install

# activate the new poetry environment
poetry shell
```

If the poetry environment is active, you can use **rclip** locally, as described in the [Usage](#usage) section above.
